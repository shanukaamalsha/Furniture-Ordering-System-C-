# 🪑 Furniture Ordering System (C++ Project)

This is a console-based Furniture Ordering System built using **C++**. It simulates a simple order management system for a furniture store, allowing users to view products, place orders, and manage summaries through a terminal-based interface.

## 🎯 Purpose

This project was developed as a functional and object-oriented programming exercise using **C++**. It focuses on:

- File handling
- Menu-driven interaction
- Use of classes and objects
- Input validation
- Modular structure

## 📄 Project Documentation

📘 A detailed **Software Requirements Specification (SRS)** document is included in this repository. It outlines the system's:

- Functional & non-functional requirements  
- Use case descriptions  
- System architecture overview  
- Design considerations  

> You can find the SRS document inside the repository as:  
> 📂 `SRS.pdf`

This makes it a useful reference for academic, documentation, and software planning purposes.
